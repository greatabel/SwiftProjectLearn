# Running Unit Tests

Edit the scheme to make sure that all available test bundles have been added to the Test configuration. To run unit
tests select "Test" from the "Product" menu in Xcode. This will compile and run the unit tests. Note that if you have
not finished your implementation or there are inconsistencies between the symbol names the unit tests are expecting and
what you have implemented, the tests will not compile and you will receive errors. The errors should indicate what
symbols are missing to help you track down where the inconsistency is. If your implementation is finished and correct,
all the unit tests should pass.

# Executing the Simulation

To execute the simulation code select "Run" from the "Product" menu in Xcode. After your code has executed you can view
your output in the console by selecting "Activate Console" from the "Debug Area" sub-menu o f the "View" menu.

# Example Output

Below is some example output that you can compare your output. Your output should be identical to this output, with the
exception of the elements that are influenced by random variation (times and whether or not a participant succeeds or
fails).

# Submit and Verify Your Work

Use the git client you prefer (the git command line tool, Xcode, the Sourcetree app, etc.) to commit all your work so far.  Make
sure to include a commit message briefly describing the work being commited. Once your work has been comitted use your git
client to push those changes back to the origin server so they can be graded. _This is the only acceptable method of submitting
your assignment._

If you would like to verify that your work has been committed and pushed properly you should clone a second copy of your
repository in a new location.  Once you have validated that the contents of this copy are correct you should delete it to avoid
having multiple copies of your repository.  There is nothing inherently wrong with having multiple copies of a repository, but it
will cause problems if you are working in one and trying to perform your commits and other git commands in the other.
