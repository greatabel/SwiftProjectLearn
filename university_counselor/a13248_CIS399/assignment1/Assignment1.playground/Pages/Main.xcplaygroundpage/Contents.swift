# Main swift file

This work should be done in the main.swift file that already exists in the project.

The main.swift file is the entry point into a Swift command line program. Code can be written directly in the file
similar to a playground and this code will be executed when the program is run.

1. To run the triathlon simulation first create an instance of the `TriathlonEvent` class.

2. Create and register participants for the event with the following types and names:

	* A `Swimmer` named "Cassi"
	* A `Swimmer` named "Jason"
	* A `Swimmer` named "Kathy"
	* A `Cyclist` named "Asia"
	* A `Cyclist` named "David"
	* A `Runner` named "Sigh"
	* A `Runner` named "Becky"
	* An `Athlete` named "Charles"
	* An `Athlete` named "Chuck"

3. After all the participants have been registered simulate the event.

4. Once the event has been simulated print the following:
	* if there is a winner print the text "<winner name> wins first place with a total time of <total time> minutes!"
	* otherwise print the text "No one finished the race!"

The next page will describe how to [run Unit Tests, execute the simulation, and show example output](@next).
