# Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to create a simple triathlon simulation command line program using many of the features
of the Swift programming language to help prepare you for writing iOS apps.  Additionally you will be utilizing git to commit
your work intermittently.  The pages of this playground will walk you through the implementation, with each page having
you create a piece of the code that will be part of the simulation.  You may want to utilize the second Editor panel in Xcode
to view the playground and your code at the same time. You can add an additional editor by clicking the Add Editor button
located in the upper right corner of the editor area in Xcode. You can hold the option key while clicking this to change if
Xcode will add the editor to the right or below the existing editor. Once you have a new editor you can select the
playground file in the navigation bar for that editor.

The project contains some pre-written unit tests which will test the code you write. Because Swift is a case sensitive
language (as most are), you must take extra caution in making sure your names match the specification given in this
playground precisely; if they do not, the tests will not compile properly. Once your implementation is finished you
will be able to choose the "Test" option from the "Product" menu in order to run the tests and make sure that your
implementation is correct. If any tests fail, examine the failure messages for an indication of where the bug in your
code is.

The next page will describe the first implementation task: [Implementing the Sport enum](@next).
