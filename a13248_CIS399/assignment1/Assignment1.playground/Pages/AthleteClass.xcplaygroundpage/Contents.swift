# Athlete class

This work should be done in the Athlete.swift file that already exists in the project.

The `Athlete` class represents an athlete in the triathlon simulation. The `Athlete` class implementation should:

1. conform to the `Participant` protocol
2. have a `name` constant property of type `String` with no initial value defined (it will be set in the initializer)
3. have a `favoriteSport` of type `Sport?` computed property which returns nil
4. have an initializer that:
	* takes a single parameter with the label `name` of type `String`
	* sets the initial value of the name constant property to the parameter value

Remember to enable the `AthleteTests` test bundle and run the tests to validate your work.

Use the git client you prefer (the git command line tool, Xcode, the Sourcetree app, etc.) to commit all your work so far.  Make
sure to include a commit message briefly describing the work being commited.

The next page will describe how to [implement the Swimmer class](@next).
