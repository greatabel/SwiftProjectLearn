# Cyclist class

This work should be done in the Cyclist.swift file that already exists in the project.

The `Cyclist` class is a subcass of the `Athlete` class that provides a more specific implementation. The `Cyclist`
class implementation should:

1. have an override implementation of the `favoriteSport` computed property which returns `Sport.cycling`

Remember to enable the `CyclistTests` test bundle and run the tests to validate your work.

Use the git client you prefer (the git command line tool, Xcode, the Sourcetree app, etc.) to commit all your work so far.  Make
sure to include a commit message briefly describing the work being commited.

The next page will describe how to [implement the Runner class](@next).
